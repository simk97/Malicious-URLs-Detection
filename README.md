# Malicious-URLs-Detection
This project focuses on the problem of malicious URLs in cyber security and compares, studies and concludes
the best machine learning based solution for it. Malicious URLs are one of the biggest cyber security
threats posed in the current time. Malicious URLs can be defined as websites that attempt to install
malware onto your device, malware can be explained as anything that disrupt device operation, collects
personal information or gain partial or total control of the device. These websites look legitimate and can
cause serious security concerns to both organizations and individuals, some of these websites also use
drive-by download. Drive â€“ by download enables the website to install malware on your device without
asking any sort of permission which is a major threat to end user's privacy. By insuring a complete blockage
of malicious URLs, we can protect sensitive data, user and organization privacy and prevent disruptive
operations on personal devices. Machine learning can be successfully used to detect whether a URL is
malicious or safe, the problem posed here is a binary classification problem, which is that the URL can
either be malicious or safe, only two of the target classes are possible. In further reading, we discuss
various machine learning algorithms and conclude the one that gives us the highest accuracy.

The problem discussed is a binary classification problem and thus, various machine learning
classification algorithms are studied and applied to this problem i.e. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors; logistic regression can be applied to detect malicious URLs with the highest
accuracy of 98% practically.
